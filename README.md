# PFG_Messenger
Messenger App built in Kotlin for Android. Features a login/register page with authentication by Firebase. Users can add an image as well which is
saved to Firebase Storage. Users can send messages to anyone on the app. 
  

# Technologies used:
 * Kotlin
 * Firebase Auth, Realtime Database, & Storage
 * Kotlin groupie extension for RecyclerViews/RV Adapters & ViewHolders.
 * Picasso for image rendering
 
# What did I learn
This was my first mobile app project on Kotlin. I learned about how to implement Recycler Views and their adapters and that it is a lot of boilerplate,
I was introduced to groupie to make the code less cluttered and the process as a whole easier to grasp. I also was first introduced to xml. 
I learned to code layouts using xml. Additionally, I learned how to implement Firebase Auth as well as Realtime Database. So I could use event
listeners on the db so messages are sent and received & UI updated in realtime. Also learned how to implement a "latest messages" page which is
essentially the home page after you log in but to have it show the last message sent between them like you see in modern messengers.
It was very exciting to see it work.

  
# Hurdles Overcome
